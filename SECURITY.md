# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Panoptes is pre-release software. Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch and released as part of the next tagged version. Older tags are not guaranteed to receive backports.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report potential security issues privately so we can address them promptly:

- Prefer opening a draft advisory at <https://github.com/nmapaye/panoptes/security/advisories/new>.
- If that is not possible, use the private contact listed in the repository profile or organization page.

Include as much detail as you can (steps to reproduce, impacted components, suggested fixes). You will receive an acknowledgment within three business days.

We aim to provide a remediation timeline update within ten business days. Once a fix is available, we will credit reporters who opt in to disclosure recognition.
